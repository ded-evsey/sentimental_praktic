" A little of Deadpool's incessant winkiness goes a long way, and by the time the movie was over, all I felt was sore."
" The film's greatest asset is Reynolds, who in Deadpool finally found the role of his dreams."
" It's overstuffed, and essentially empty."
" If you love films that keep you guessing, laughing and surprised on the edge of your seat, this is a must-see."
 The star does his schtick and invites us in for a giggle but there's no weight to the character or to Reynolds's playing of him. He's like Robert Downey Jr. without the soul.
" Despite lacking the freshness of 2016 feature, the sequel is funny, energetic, and determined not to take itself seriously (even when serious things happen)."
" ""Deadpool 2"" is annoying and bad."
" It's a long movie and when its star isn't on screen and cracking wise, the boundary-pushing shocks and endless self-references wear thin."
" The direction by David Leitch is brisk and fluid, and the script, which Reynolds co-wrote with Deadpool scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is, as noted, a substantial upgrade on that earlier effort. "
" The result feels a bit like a lavishly produced, superhero- and supervillain-stocked standup comedy special, with fight scenes, chases and explosions spliced into footage of the hero telling you about the wild couple of weeks he just had."
" It is a fairly brilliant sendup of comic-book action movies, as well as also being an excellent example of one."
" Rather than face its own moral incoherence, Deadpool 2 blinks."
" Seriously subversive, seriously funny, seriously profane, occasionally even serious, Deadpool 2 is the best kind of cinematic entertainment. Seriously."
 It's Family Guy: The Movie.
" Doesn't build on the first film, choosing instead to replay the greatest hits. If you're a fan of those hits, then you'll enjoy this encore, but anyone who wasn't amused by the first go-round isn't going to hop on board for this do-over."
" The film's impulse to profess a knowing, snarky superiority can become painfully awkward."
" The Deadpool movies occasionally push the bounds of taste, but they don't take real comedic risks. Viewed as more of an action-comedy, then, Deadpool 2 works passably well. [Full review in Spanish]"
" Despite a tendency toward elephantitis in story and scope, not to mention blatant franchise pandering, Deadpool 2 still plays like the runt of the comic-book litter. We mean that as a compliment."
" In two years, Deadpool has gone from the scrappy class clown to the annoying wiseass in the back of the room spewing crude insults to amuse himself."
 Caustic and unexpected.
" A movie that feels scribbled in pencil crayon, drenched in Jolt cola and coated with the dust of a thousand discarded bags of Flamin' Hot Cheetos... As it is, Deadpool 2 is a film that is merely aggressively aggressive."
" Every cultural moment needs a smart-ass, and sometimes, you take what you can get."
" This ultra-violent sequel to one of the most successful R-rated movies of all time is often hilarious, but the skeleton holding it together can't really hold up its end of the bargain. For most people, though, that will be OK."
" Deadpool 2 makes a point of not taking itself too seriously, which can be harder than it looks. And if that works somewhat fitfully, the sequel delivers consistently enough to keep this colorful mercenary laughing all the way to the bank."
" If the filmmakers were as self-reflexive as they pretend to be, they'd find a way to show that Deadpool's insides are becoming as charred as his face."
 Where it surprises - and why it works so well - is how it balances an actually touching undercurrent alongside superhero subversiveness.
" Saucy, overstuffed and very entertaining."
" Dizzy fun for a while, like eating Twinkies on a Gravitron. Eventually, though, it just wears you out."
 The eagerness of Deadpool to call out its own shortcomings earns this trash-talking franchise a lot of goodwill.
 Unfortunately the new sequel... doesn't have enough of too much; less charitable viewers might even argue that it has too much of not enough.
 Wisecracking and fourth wall-breaking as ever.
" Deadpool 2 is, above all else, a lot of fun. Sometimes it maybe doesn't take itself seriously enough. But in a genre that takes itself so deadly seriously, this is like a breath of fresh air."
" Comes blazing out of the shoot, but dips in its second hour, like a stretched-out piece of taffy. Still, there is a lot left to like here, and Reynolds and company crank out better, more outrageous laughs than most pure comedies."
 What drives this franchise is the same force that drives so much culture and politics right now: the self-pity of a white man with a relentless need to be the center of attention.
" Reynolds, one of three credited writers, took more creative control with this sequel. That may sound like trouble, but the innate self-effacement built into the actor's breezy motormouth skill set apparently kept his better instincts at the fore."
" With Reynolds' charismatic irreverence at its core, the pic moves from bloody mayhem to lewd comedy and back fluidly, occasionally even making room to go warm and mushy."
" Deadpool 2 is kind of like that zany guy you met at a party once. Yeah, he was fun that first time out. But when you meet him again, he's just more of the same and that's ... boring."
" Deadpool 2 is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements, terrific ensemble work -- and for dessert, perhaps the best end-credits ""cookie"" scene ever."
" In almost every respect, this sequel is an improvement on its 2016 predecessor: Sharper, grosser, more narratively coherent and funnier overall, with a few welcome new additions."
 The perfect Avengers antidote.
" The original ""Deadpool"" caught lightning in a bottle. The sequel sparks only intermittently."
